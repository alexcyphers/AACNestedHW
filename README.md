This project I used associative arrays to help design software for people with disabilities with an AAC. I had to update the associative array program to be used for with the AAC, and I wrote two classes, AACCategory and AACMappings. AACMappings is used for mapping categories and the stuff within the categories. AACCategory represents the mapping for a single page.
